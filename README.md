# AWS CloudWatch Logging with Python

This guide will walk you through setting up the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), preparing a Python virtual environment, and running a Python script that logs to AWS CloudWatch.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system (Preferably Python 3.6 or later).
- Access to an AWS account and the ability to create IAM users.

## Step 1: Installing AWS CLI

1. **Download AWS CLI**: Visit the [AWS CLI official page](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and download the installer for your operating system.
2. **Install AWS CLI**: Follow the provided instructions to install the AWS CLI.
3. **Configure AWS CLI**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run `aws configure`.
   - Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format as prompted.
   - These credentials should correspond to an IAM user with permissions for CloudWatch.

## Step 2: Setting up Python Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run `python -m venv venv` (This creates a virtual environment named `venv`).
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows: Run `venv\Scripts\activate`.
   - On MacOS/Linux: Run `source venv/bin/activate`.
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory with at least `watchtower` listed.
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Step 3: Running the Python Script

1. **Prepare Your Script**:
   - Ensure your Python script (e.g., `main.py`) is in the project directory.
   - The script should be properly configured to use the correct AWS CloudWatch Log Group.
2. **Run the Script**:
   - In the terminal (with the virtual environment activated), run `python main.py`.

## Step 4: Verifying Logs in CloudWatch

- Log in to your AWS Console.
- Go to the CloudWatch service.
- Navigate to "Logs" and then to your specified Log Group to see the logs generated by your script.
